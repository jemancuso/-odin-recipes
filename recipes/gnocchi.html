    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gnocchi are a type of miniature pasta dumplings, usually made from wheat, eggs, potatoes. With a lightly dense texture and potato flavor, they are a hearty and unique type of pasta. Gnocchi have been a traditional type of pasta in Italy since Roman times, though they are said to have originated in the Middle East.</p>

        <li>2 potatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Peel potatoes and add to pot. Cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into half-inch pieces.</li>
